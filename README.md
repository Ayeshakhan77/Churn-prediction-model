# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecommunications Company

A data science project focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to help telecom companies identify customers likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project applies a complete **data science workflow**, including:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Insights and business recommendations  

---

## 🧠 Objective

Predict which customers are likely to **churn (leave the company)** based on their demographics, service usage, and contract information.

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`  
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
- Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets  
- No missing values were found in the dataset  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key findings:
- Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn  
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate  
- Lack of technical support strongly correlates with customer churn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Trained and compared multiple models:
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUC |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|------|
| Logistic Regression | - | - | - | - |
| Decision Tree | - | - | - | - |
| **Random Forest** | **Best** | **Best** | **Best** | **Best** |
| Gradient Boosting | - | - | - | - |

✅ **Random Forest** performed the best and was selected as the final model.
